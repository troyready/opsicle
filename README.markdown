## Installation
Add this line to your project's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'opsicle'
```

### Set up an Application to use opsicle

```yaml
# your_app_root/.opsicle

staging:
  stack_id: opsworks-stack-id
  app_id: opsworks-app-id
production:
  stack_id: opsworks-stack-id
  app_id: opsworks-app-id
production2:
  stack_id: opsworks-stack-id
  app_id: opsworks-app-id
  profile_name: production
  region: us-west-2
```

Opsicle v2+ uses AWS SDK shared credentials.  See: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/a-new-and-standardized-way-to-manage-credentials-in-the-aws-sdks/
```ini
# ~/.aws/credentials

[staging]
  aws_access_key_id = YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
[production]
  aws_access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Using Opsicle

Run `opsicle help` for a full list of commands and their uses.

Opsicle accepts a `--verbose` flag or the VERBOSE environment variable to show additional information as commands are run.
Opsicle accepts a DEBUG environment variable to show additional logging such as stack traces for failed commands.

Some common commands:

### Deployments
```bash

# Run a basic deploy for the current app
opsicle deploy staging

# Run the deploy for production
opsicle deploy production

```
By default, deploying opens the Opsicle Stack Monitor.
You may also use `--browser` to open the OpsWorks deployments screen instead,
or `--no-monitor` to ignore both monitoring options

### Failure-log
```bash

# Get the failure log from a deployment for the current app
opsicle failure-log staging
```

This will open a browser window the failure log from the most recent failure log from
a deployment in the current app.

### SSH
```bash
# SSH to a server instance in the given environment stack
opsicle ssh staging

# Set your user SSH key (PUBLIC KEY) for OpsWorks
opsicle ssh-key staging <key-file>

```

### Stack Monitor
```bash
# Launch the Opsicle Stack Monitor for the given environment stack
opsicle monitor staging

```
### Updating Custom Chef Recipes
```bash
 # Upload a cookbooks directory to S3 and update the stack's custom cookbooks
 opsicle chef-update staging --bucket-name my-opsworks-cookbooks

```
This command accepts a --path argument to the directory of cookbooks to upload. It defaults to 'cookbooks'.
It also accepts a --bucket-name for the base s3 bucket. This flag is required.

### Update
Update an OpsWorks resource like a stack, layer or app with a given set of property values.
The values can be passed as inline JSON or as a path to a YAML file.
Naming and value format needs to follow what is defined for the [AWS Ruby SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/AWS/OpsWorks/Client.html).
Upon successful execution a table of the resulting changes is printed to stdout.

For example:
```
opsicle --debug update staging stack -j '{"use_opsworks_security_groups":false, "custom_json":"{\"foo\":5}"}'
opsicle --debug update staging app -y app.yml
```
